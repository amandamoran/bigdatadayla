    "#### Convert each Spark Dataframe to a Pandas Dataframe. This works as-is because we are working with a small dataset. For larger datasets only convert to Pandas if data can fit in memory. From there loop over each row and get the sentiment score (anything + is postive and anything - or 0 is negative). The \"positive\" function will return true if the tweet is postive.
